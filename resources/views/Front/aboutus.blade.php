                                the leading journal in these fields in the world.
                                The journal quarterly publishes original papers, review papers, conceptual frameworks,

                                case studies, empirical research, technical notes, and book reviews. Selection of
                                submissions for publication is based on relevance, clarity, topicality,
                                individuality and interest to academics and practitioners. We firmly believe that ethical
                                conduct is the most essential virtue of any academic activities.
                                Hence, any act of plagiarism is a totally unacceptable academic misconduct.</p>
